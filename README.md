# CLI-english-test
A primitive english test \o/ 

When I was starting to learn how to code in 2015 I got really impressed with the power if some "if's" and "elses". For what I remember, my first great momment with programming was not the "Hello World". It hapenned when I had a english test and decided to use what I have learned in the C language to make a test for myself and study. I loved to built it. I even tryed to set this for sale. (LOL)

My grade on the test was really good. As you must to know, trough repetition we can learn everything, so I memorized a lot of english words.

Unfortunatelly I didn't found the source code to put here for you see thousands of switch-case sentences, but I found the executable and decided to upload, because I never want to forget this history.
